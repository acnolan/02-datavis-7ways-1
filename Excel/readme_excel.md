Plotting MPG is difficult because it has several N/A values. I have made two excel sheets. One ignoring those rows, and one deriving those values as the average of the MPG column.

Trying to use strictly excel features, avoiding code/VBA

currently removed the N/A rows, might try averaging them

Excel very nice to go from a csv to a very simple data vis, but you have to jump through hoops to get fancier ones
